# EEG_User_Auth
This repository uses the WAY_EEG_GAL public EEG dataset [1] and performs user authentication using machine learning algorithms. 

Feature extraction and signal preprocessing is performed using Matlab. The Signal Processing Toolbox is required to run the Matlab code. A computer with 16 GB DDR is recommended for feature extraction.
